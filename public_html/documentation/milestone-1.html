<h2><u>Behaviors and Attitudes</u></h2>

<h2><u>Frustrations</u></h2>
<p>Eugene hasn't been able to find a web developer that's comfortable building a website to showcase his work since he shoots boudoir photo shoots.</p>
<p>Eugene is tired of using 3rd party website hosts in fear that it's easier for his work to get stolen.</p>

<h2><u>Goals</u></h2>
<p>Eugene's goal is to find an inclusive and reliable web developer to help make his website dreams come true. Someone who will assist him with his ideas instead of running the project into something they think it should be.</p>
